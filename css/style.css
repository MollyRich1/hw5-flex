/* STEP 1 ANIMATION 
Animate the logo with keyframes.  
(Here is a keyframes reference.) It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  
It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1. The animation should 
take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded. **You can complete this step later 
in the process - it won’t affect the larger views.*/

/* STEP 2 
Edit the body element to use the Poppins font (using Google fonts) with serif as a backup. 
 It should also use the image “concrete_seamless.png” as a background-image
  with a backup color of #f1f1f1.*/
